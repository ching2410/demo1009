# Replit Configuration

## Overview

This is a simple browser-based reaction time testing game written in Traditional Chinese (zh-TW). The game presents users with visual cues and measures their response time, providing an interactive way to test and improve reaction speed. It's built as a single-page application using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any external dependencies.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Single-page application**: Built entirely in one HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript
- **Vanilla web technologies**: Uses pure HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript without any frameworks or libraries
- **Responsive design**: Implements viewport meta tag and flexible styling for different screen sizes
- **Event-driven interaction**: Game logic is based on user click/touch events and timing mechanisms

### Game Logic Design
- **State-based system**: Game progresses through different states (ready, waiting, reaction phases)
- **Visual feedback system**: Uses background color changes and text messages to guide user interaction
- **Timing measurement**: Captures precise reaction times using JavaScript's timing functions
- **CSS transitions**: Smooth visual transitions for better user experience

### UI/UX Patterns
- **Minimalist design**: Clean, centered layout with focus on the game area
- **Full-screen interaction**: Entire viewport acts as the clickable game area
- **Visual state indicators**: Different colors and messages indicate current game state
- **Responsive typography**: Scalable font sizes for different device screens

## External Dependencies

This project has no external dependencies:
- No third-party JavaScript libraries or frameworks
- No external CSS frameworks
- No API integrations
- No database requirements
- No server-side components required

The game runs entirely in the browser using native web technologies, making it completely self-contained and portable.
